This is a project from the book ["Concurrent Data Processing in Elixir"](https://pragprog.com/titles/sgdpelixir/concurrent-data-processing-in-elixir/)

The end of chapter two closes with you having built a supervised job processing application
and for you to consider adding some additional features to it.
